# SteGriff's Azure Projects are down for now

*This notice was written 2018-11-08*

Hi there!

You probably arrived here via:

 * paprika.me.uk
 * datafree.zone
 * textapps.me
 * textapps.zone

Unfortunately, I no longer have free access to Microsoft Azure to host these projects. They are down until further notice when I get it together ðŸ™‚

Apologies for any inconvenience.

In the meantime, you can find my website at http://stegriff.co.uk and I'm SteGriff on Twitter, GitHub, Glitch, and dev.to.

Thanks for understanding! ðŸ™Œ

**SteGriff**
